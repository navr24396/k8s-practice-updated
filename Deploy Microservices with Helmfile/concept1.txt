Deployment options
1. install each release in chart individually by executing command                          #manual way
   helm install -f <path to custom values.yaml> <release name> <chart name>  
2. writing install and uninstall script i.e install.sh & uninstall.sh                       #inefficient way
   chmod u+x install.sh    
   chmod u+x uninstall.sh

  #after writing helmfile we have to install helmfile by 
  apt install helmfile
  helmfile sync                           #to update or sync cluster with desired state as mentioned in helmfile
  helmfile lists                          #shows installed releases helmfile manages
  helmfile destroy                        #to uninstall releases
